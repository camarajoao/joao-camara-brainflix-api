# Brainflix

Brainflix simulates a new video streaming platform. 

The project is split into 3 parts (sprints of 1 week each). Mockups for this project are provided and the main objective of the project is to create a fully functional website. 

Brainflix is my first project created using React framework. The main purpose of Brainflix is to familiarize myself with React, create a new project, install packages and create components.
